# sampleCNN_visualization

The filter visualization code that I've been used for my experiments in the paper [Sample-level Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Music Auto-tagging using Raw Waveforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01789)

The code was developed based on this blog post [How convolutional neural networks see the world](https://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html)
